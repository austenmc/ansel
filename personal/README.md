# Personal Setup
These are files I use on my own machine. Feel free to peruse them as an example.

## Dropbox
I'm using Dropbox to remotely sync files pulled off the SD card.

Install `dropbox` and `dropboxd` using these instructions:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-dropbox-client-as-a-service-on-ubuntu-14-04

You then have to add folders manually to exclude, and you have to include all of them :(
```
dropbox exclude add [dirs]
```
